@article{barabasi,
	Abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World
                  Wide Web are best described as networks with complex
                  topology. A common property of many large networks
                  is that the vertex connectivities follow a
                  scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was
                  found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms:
                  (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of
                  new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach
                  preferentially to sites that are already well
                  connected. A model based on these two ingredients
                  reproduces the observed stationary scale-free
                  distributions, which indicates that the development
                  of large networks is governed by robust
                  self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the
                  particulars of the individual systems.},
